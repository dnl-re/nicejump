# Readme

This IntelliJ Plugin helps to move quicker through your code by enabling you to jump, select or delete up to a specific next character or word.

## Progress

As of now this is only a very minimal viable plugin:
* Only jump and selection works.
* Input Dialog looks like crap.

*I first want to test if I use this plugin, before spending time over engineering it.*

### Todo:
* Figure out to get rid of this obese duplication by introducing other classes (see in-code Todo)
* Use toolbar like the find toolbar (Ctrl + F)
* Let every search result be highlighted
* Get rid of Ctrl Shift shortcuts in favor of hitting Shift Enter in search box
